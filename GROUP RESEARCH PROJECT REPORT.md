3.1 Survey Design 
An organized online survey has been designed that had:
  Demographic questions (age, gender identity, race/ethnicity, disability status, tenure, employment level) 
  Five composite domains of DEI, which are calculated using several Likert-scale items:
      Representation
      Psychological Safety
      Inclusive Leadership
      Bias Reporting & Accountability
      Visibility of Initiatives
Responses were measured using a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). 

3.2 Sampling and Data Collection
   Instrument we used: Google Forms containing 25 questionnair.
   Sample size: N = 60 employees responses.
   Sampling procedure we did : Convenience sampling within in some multinational organisation.
   Timeline : Data was collected between 15th November to 1st December, 2025.
   Respondent profiles we get:
      43% aged between 25-34 years.
      43% are women, 35% of them are men,and 5% non-binary/gender-diverse.
      33% of underrepresented racial/ethnic groupings.
      17% who considered themselves having a disability.
      Most of them were individual respondents (N=29) or people managers (N=18)
      
3.3 Data Handling and Preparation 
 In order to be accurate and more reliable in the analysis process, standard data handling methods were used and applied on the responses of the survey. It was checked that all the entries in the dataset were complete, consistent and ina a format that would be nalyzed automatically.Simple assessments were conducted in order to determine the presence of any repeated answers, lack of answers, and demographical labels anomalies. Variable names (example.. Q_Represent_Leadership, Q_Bias_Reporting) were standardised and made easier to read, as well as compatible with Python. Every step of the analysis was recorded to enhance transparency and reproducibility when working in the group.
